Patient A must be treated according to the severity of their symptoms: Severe high-gradient AS with symptoms (class I recommendation, level B evidence): This suggests that in cases where a patient has severe aortic stenosis and is experiencing symptoms (such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting), it is strongly recommended (class I) to consider medical therapy or surgical intervention.

The recommendation is supported by level B evidence.\n","\n","Severe AS when undergoing other cardiac surgery (class I recommendation, level B evidence): If a patient with severe aortic stenosis is undergoing other cardiac surgeries (like coronary artery bypass grafting), it's strongly recommended (class I) to address the aortic stenosis at the same time. This is based on level B evidence.\n","\n","Asymptomatic severe AS and low surgical risk (class IIa recommendation, level B evidence): For patients with severe aortic stenosis who do not exhibit symptoms and have a low risk for surgical complications, it is reasonable (class IIa) to consider surgical intervention. This recommendation is based on level B evidence.\n","\n","Symptomatic with low-flow/low-gradient severe AS (class IIa recommendation, level B evidence): If a patient with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis has low blood flow across the aortic valve (low-flow/low-gradient), it's considered reasonable (class IIa) to consider medical therapy or surgery. This recommendation is supported by level B evidence.\n","\n","Moderate AS and undergoing other cardiac surgery (class IIa recommendation, level C evidence): In cases where a patient has moderate aortic stenosis and is undergoing other cardiac surgeries, it may be reasonable (class IIa) to address the moderate aortic stenosis during the same surgical procedure.
