Mild disease in the follicular phase is treated with oral antibiotics eg doxycycline. More severe disease may require the clindamycine and rifampacin co-treatment, Severe disease is treated with systemics eg methotrexate,ciclospori, acitretin or biologics eg adalimumab, secukinumab, infliximab.Surgery is recommended for treatment resistant cases and is often the definitive treatment. Flare ups can be controlled with a combination of an oral corticosteroid and oral antibiotic. ##\n","\n","\n"]}],"source":["import time\n","#Shuffle the names for each of the ten vignettes\n","openai.api_key = \"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\"\n","\n","#Prompting GPT-3 for each prompt x gender x race combo\n","#Saving the results as a json\n","\n","out1 = []\n","for q in range(15):\n","  open_prompt_standard = create_open_standard(q)\n","  print(\"---------- DOING VIGNETTE #\", q, \" ----------\")\n","\n","  #Sampling closed prompts\n","  available = [i for i in range(15) if i != q]\n","  sample = random.sample(available, 2)\n","  closed_prompt0 = create_closed(sample[0])\n","  closed_prompt2 = create_closed(sample[1])\n","\n","  #Standardizing closed prompts\n","  closed_prompt0 = standardize_closed(closed_prompt0)\n","  closed_prompt2 = standardize_closed(closed_prompt2)\n","  closed_prompt = closed_prompt0 + closed_prompt2\n","\n","  #Generate by going through genders and races\n","  for g in genders:\n","      open_prompt = genderize_norace_open(open_prompt_standard, g)\n","      print(open_prompt)\n","      print(closed_prompt)\n","      final_prompt = closed_prompt + open_prompt\n","      #EXAMPLE WITH GPT-3 OPEN AI API / REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN EXPERIMENT\n","      #openai.api_key = \"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\"\n","      response = openai.Completion.create(\n","          model=\"davinci\",\n","          prompt = final_prompt, logprobs=logp, max_tokens = max_tokens\n","          )\n","      response_dict = {'closed_prompt': closed_prompt,\n","                      'open_prompt': open_prompt,\n","                      'prompt_num': q,\n","                      'gender': g,\n","                      'choices': response}\n","      out1.append(response_dict)\n","      time.sleep(5)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":20,"metadata":{"id":"PtT_lX_MHmQZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1694131215387,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":31,"user":{"displayName":"Ashlyn Roice","userId":"10644469294244809978"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["#Getting the results (probabilities) out of the GPT-3 output\n","#Adapt to your own experiment!\n","results_data3 = pd.DataFrame(columns=['context', 'gender', 'prob_gpt3_yes',\n","                                      'prob_gpt3_no', 'gpt3_answer',\n","                                      'gpt3_explanation', 'gpt3_full', 'closed_prompts', 'open_prompts'])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":21,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1694131215388,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":17,"user":{"displayName":"Ashlyn Roice","userId":"10644469294244809978"}},"outputId":"313528d3-052b-42fe-c010-20673a376e5a","id":"GRRNzCRFHmQZ"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["man\n","woman\n","man\n","woman\n","man\n","woman\n","man\n","woman\n","man\n","woman\n","man\n","woman\n","man\n","woman\n","man\n","woman\n","man\n","woman\n","man\n","woman\n","man\n","woman\n","man\n","woman\n","man\n","woman\n","man\n","woman\n","man\n","woman\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["<ipython-input-21-6f461cb0a1e9>:30: FutureWarning: The frame.append method is deprecated and will be removed from pandas in a future version.
