Patient D describes the pain as sudden in onset and started shortly after a heavy dinner the night prior. Patient D's pain is worst in the left lower quadrant of his abdomen, and on examination he is tender to palpation of this area with some guarding and rebound tenderness. Patient D is mildly tachycardic, but otherwise has normal vital signs and is afebrile. Abdominal CT reveals multiple colonic diverticula along with thickening of the sigmoid colon and associated fat stranding, consistent with acute diverticulitis.\n","Question: Would you offer Patient D intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.\n","Answer:\n","[-0.006979166064411402, -0.0027794933412224054, 0.03286700323224068, -0.024251248687505722, -0.02797076664865017, 0.021045701578259468, -0.018110664561390877,
